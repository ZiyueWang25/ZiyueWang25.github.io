<p>All of the following metric is for 1 query, we need to average them to get an overall score for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Q</code> queries.</p>
<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Accuracy@K</code>: Whether top K results contain the relevant results.
    <ol>
      <li>Formula: \(A(K)=(\sum_{i=1}^K I(i)) &gt; 0\). \(I(i)\) is an indicator function suggesting whether the \(i_{th}\) position is relevant or not.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Precision@K</code>: How many relevant results among the top K.
    <ol>
      <li>Formula: \(P(K) =\frac{1}{K}\sum_{i=1}^KI(i)\).</li>
      <li>Only for binary cases</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Recall@K</code>: How many relevant results among the top K compared with all relevant results.
    <ol>
      <li>Formula: \(R(K) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^KI(i)\). \(m\) is the total number of relevant results overall.</li>
      <li>Only for binary cases</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AP@K</code> (Average Precision): the weighted mean of precision at each threshold; the weight is the increase in recall from the prior threshold.
    <ol>
      <li>Formula: \(AP@K = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{k=1}^K P(k)I(k)\)</li>
      <li>A different way to represent \(AP@K\): We can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Recall@K</code> here by using its delta format \(\Delta R(k) = R(k) - R(k-1)\). It would be \(\frac{1}{m}\) if a relevant result is at position \(k\), otherwise it is 0. and it becomes \(AP@K = \sum_{k=1}^K P(k) * \Delta R(k)\). In other words, it is the area under Precision-Recall curve.</li>
      <li>Only for binary cases</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RR</code> (Reciprocal Rank): reciprocal of the rank of the first relevant item in a ranked list.
    <ol>
      <li>Formula: \(RR = \frac{1}{\text{rank of the first relevant item}}\)</li>
      <li>Only for binary cases.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NDCG@K</code> (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)
    <ol>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CG@K</code>: Sum of relevance of all results in a search result list \(CG@K = \sum_{k=1}^K rel(k)\), \(rel(k)\) is the relevance score of the result at \(k\).</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DCG@K</code>: Give earlier result higher weights: \(DCG@K = \sum_{k=1}^K\frac{2^{rel(k)} - 1}{ \log_2(k+1)}\)</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NDCG@K</code>: normalize <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DCG</code> by its perfect ranking result (a.k.an Ideal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DCG</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IDCG</code>)) to reduce the effect that different search results can vary in length.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Normalized Kendall tau distance at K:
    <ol>
      <li>\(K_n@K(\tau_1, \tau_2) = \frac{K_d}{\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \sum_{\{i,j\}\in \mathbb{K}, i &lt; j} \bar K_{i,j}(\tau_1, \tau_2)\). \(\mathbb{K}\) is the set of unordered pairs of distinct elements among the top K in \(\tau_1\) and \(\tau_2\). \(\bar K_{i,j}(\tau_1, \tau_2) = 0\) if \(i\) and \(j\) are in the same order in \(\tau_1\) and \(\tau_2\), otherwise 1.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Spearman Rho:
    <ol>
      <li>Formula: \(\rho = \frac{cov(R(X), R(Y))}{\delta_{R(x)}\delta_{R(Y)}}\)</li>

There are many great resources online, so I decide to gather them down here for reference.</p>

<h1 id="pip-joint">PIP Joint</h1>
<ul>
  <li>https://www.camp4humanperformance.com/blog-2/pip-jugs
    <ul>
      <li><strong>high-rate rotational loading is more stressful on the fingers than static loading</strong></li>
      <li>when you can get your middle and distal bones around the edge of the jug, in that context, <strong>most of the stress in the fingers goes into the PIP joint.</strong></li>
      <li>The PIP Joint can suffer from overdoing easy climbing.</li>
      <li>A high volume of easy training can be <strong>counterproductive</strong>.</li>
      <li>PIP swelling are due to
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Collateral ligaments</strong> (sides of the joint)</li>
          <li><strong>A3 pulleys</strong> (hold the tendon close to the joint)</li>
          <li><strong>Volar plate</strong> (ligament across the joint where A3 attaches)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>dosage</strong> of stress stype is more important than intensity of the load.</li>
      <li>Treatment:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Avoid the high-rate rotational loading</strong> for a few weeks to months.</li>
          <li>Don’t spend weeks to months climbing easy terrain. <strong>Especially in a gym.</strong></li>
          <li>Keep loading your fingers in an <strong>easily trackable way</strong> (ladder style). Fingerboard, campus board (feet on), spray wall etc.</li>
          <li>Be <strong>patient as hell</strong> in rehab! That’s the not easy part.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <ul>
      <li>PIP joint accounts for 85% of the motion for grip strength</li>
      <li>a hinge type joint which is stable only in the sagittal plane (flexing and extending)</li>
      <li><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59d03d018a02c7512bf8b05f/1491d85e-8d95-4c35-ae8e-56977850d9e7/%2311+pip+joint.png?format=750w" alt="" /></li>
      <li><strong>Three grades of collateral ligament injuries</strong></li>
      <li>General recommendations:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stiffness and joint contraction</strong> are common with injury.</li>
          <li>There is <strong>no consensus</strong> on best treatment strategies!</li>
          <li>Most injuries <strong>rarely return to full active range of motion.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Treatment within 4 weeks</strong> is key.</li>
          <li>Immobilization beyond 3 weeks causes <strong>irreversible loss of motion!</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Early diagnosis</strong> and motion are suggested (specifically extensor power).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Doing something like finger-glides on a regular basis is not necessarily “healthy” for the joints of your fingers.</strong></li>
      <li>It really comes down to understanding the why behind any intervention. Everything comes with a cost.</li>

      <li>Components:
        <ul>
          <li>A triangular shaped <strong>fibro-cartilaginous disc</strong> (shock absorbing, guiding motion)</li>
          <li>Ligaments between the <strong>ulna and radius</strong> on both sides (palmar &amp; dorsal)</li>
          <li>Ligaments between the <strong>ulna and the carpal bones</strong></li>
          <li>A <strong>meniscal type homologoue</strong> (shock absorbing)</li>
          <li>Sub-sheath of the <strong>ECU tendon</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Cause: repetitive axial loads to the wrist when the hand is in ulnar deviation and pronation.</li>
      <li>the <strong>dosage</strong> of the stress is the culprit</li>
      <li>Even though it is still recommended to do <strong>conservative management first</strong>, the statistics show that only 1/3 of patients get symptomatic relief. That number is highly dependent on the compliance but does show how tricky these injuries can be.</li>

      <li>Alternative
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keeping the wrist neutral</strong> will do the same thing (mechanically), and it feels way less risky (good for pain reduction), especially if you’re an athlete with clicking in the wrist.</li>
          <li><strong>Wrist flexion isometric</strong> (shown on the left). Go heavy and hold for a longer time under tension.</li>
          <li><strong>Wrist extension isometric</strong> (opposite side of the forearm). Same idea.</li>
          <li><strong>Hammer curl isometric.</strong> Curl a heavy dumbbell to 90-degrees at the elbow (thumb up) and hold for time.</li>
          <li><strong>Tricep extension isometric.</strong> Opposite direction. Lower a heavy band or cable machine to 90-degrees (thumb up) and hold for time.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Eccentric flexion over a bench is not a very practical exercise.</li>
      <li>With pain at the wrist, <strong>keeping it neutral is a safe and reliable method.</strong></li>
      <li>This controlled load needs to <strong>change as your rehab progresses.</strong></li>

<h1 id="taping">Taping</h1>
<ul>
  <li>https://www.camp4humanperformance.com/blog-2/finger-taping
    <ul>
      <li>reducing stress to prevent an injury doesn’t make sense</li>
      <li><strong>taping should be part of progressive rehab plan,</strong> not a method to <em>prevent</em> one.</li>
      <li><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59d03d018a02c7512bf8b05f/a051125d-57f1-4061-a6fa-702a217606a2/%2329+finger+tape.jpg?format=1500w" alt="" /></li>
      <li>Pros
        <ul>
          <li>provide structural support and reduce pulley stress
            <ul>
              <li>H-tape is good for A2, A3 and A4. but <strong>not collateral ligament and volar plate injuries</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>provide proprioception (awareness) in the joint</li>
          <li>Modify PIP joint range of motion: make it harder to do full-crimp</li>
          <li>Reduce pain: feels safe and reduces stress and anxiety.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Cons
        <ul>
          <li>not preventative. Listen to the body and back off the volume if it sore</li>
          <li>leads to further overuse.</li>
          <li>modifying ROM for too long can reduce it long-term</li>

  <p>The unexamined life is not worth living –Socrates</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reflecting back on 2022, I experienced a lot, both outside and inside:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I changed my job from quant 💰 at BNP to software engineer 🖥️ at Google.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I moved from New York 🗽 to Seattle 🗻.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I met many awesome friends from climbing, working and friends.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I bought my first car 🚗 and it really changed my way of living.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I switched from omnivore 🍖 to Veggan 🥦 (Vegan + Egg). Today is my 117 days since my last meat bite and I felt very good to see a lower footprint and a contribution to animal protection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I become a husband, legally. 😀</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I traveled with my wife together to San Jose, San Francisco, Yosemite and Vancouver.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I start consistently doing meditation 🧘 in the morning and I have meditated for around 38.6 hours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I start consistently reading books 📚. I have read and summarized 38 books since the beginning of this year and here is my goodreads <a href="http://goodreads.com/vincentwang">profile</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wrote an open-source <a href="https://github.com/VincentWang25/USVisaAppointment">program</a> 🧑‍💻 to get US visa appointment slots and successfully got my visa stamped in Canada.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I got a Kaggle competition gold medal 🏅 on February and wrote a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tensorflow-great-barrier-reef/discussion/307718">post</a> to summarize our methods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I started reading papers seriously and upgraded my note-taking system by following <a href="https://reasonabledeviations.com/2022/04/18/molecular-notes-part-1/">Molecular Notes</a> and <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Building a Second Brain</a>. I can’t wait to see it scale up 😀</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I almost stopped using social media, like WeChat and Instagram. I freed myself for more time to enjoy what was truly worth my attention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I changed from doing rock climbing crazily into injury recovery mode. I became more patient and a long-term viewer from this one. But before the injury, I got my first single arm open hand 20mm 5s hang (that’s something probably only climbers can understand 😅)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Overall I felt proud and happy about these changes. I felt more controlled about myself and motivated every day to enjoy my life. As failure needs reflection to be avoided in the future, success needs it as well to keep the momentum. I would say the following 3 habits/methods really helped me to become the person I wanna be.</p>

<h1 id="1-reading">1 Reading</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>开卷有益 (Reading enriches the mind) —— 《与子俨等疏》</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I intentionally set the <strong>1 hour before bedtime</strong> as my reading hour, it helps me <strong>wind down for the day</strong> and <strong>step into a different world</strong> by following the books. I like reading non-fiction books since I enjoy learning new knowledge from them. I agree with this <a href="https://reasonabledeviations.com/2022/01/24/reading-philosophy/">post</a> regarding how to read a nonfiction book and I kept <strong>extracting the wisdom from books into my life</strong>. Luckily, my wife also enjoys reading books and it is really nice time to read books together in a relaxed mode. I listed a few books that helped me in different fields.</p>

<h1 id="2-tracking--scoring">2 Tracking &amp; Scoring</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first step toward change is awareness. The second step is acceptance. —Nathaniel Branden</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I started tracking how I spent my week since January 1st and it helps me reflect upon <strong>how I was doing last week</strong> and <strong>figure out the plan for next week</strong>. It redirects my focus and tracks me to see how far I am away from mastery (10,000 hours). I listed a few identities as my goals (according to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2250.The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People_Personal_Workbook">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a>) and another column named “wasted time” to track how I spend my week. Those goals can remind me of what kind of person I wanna be in the long run. The “wasted time” is usually some meaningless screen time watching youtube videos or short videos, they are sometimes really disturbing. I want to maximize my time on goal and minimize the “wasted time”.</p>

<p>To be specific, we have 24 hours per day, excluding 8 hours of sleep and 3 hours of necessary activities (eating, dressing up and etc), we are left with <strong>13 hours</strong>. For a week, we will have 13 * 7 = <strong>91 hours</strong>. It is not much. If we deduct working hours (7 * 5), it only left us with <strong>56 hours</strong> and we need to use that time to spend with our family, personal hobbies, and some wild dreams ⭐. Here is a decomposition of my time.</p>

<p>Even though I tried to record the time I spend on each goal, sometimes it is still hard to track since I might just do some misc stuff like commuting or daydreaming 🤣. I am glad to see a high ratio of “Work / Research Engineer”, “Professional Climber” and “Spouse, Friends, Son”. They are part of my core identity. Note there that I listed “Spouse, Friends, Son” as part of my time tracking because they are important, never less than “Work / Research Engineer”. Having them here kept me balanced and my goal is not solely about being a great research engineer but to be happy (I agree with the meaning of life mentioned in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38210.The_Art_of_Happiness">Happiness</a>).</p>

<p>I used <a href="https://clockify.me/">clockify</a> to <strong>track my time blocks every day</strong> and used google Sheets to record my weekly data. It is part of my weekly reflection routine and helped me stay on track.</p>

<p>Since October, after reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22544758-triggers">Triggers</a>, I started using a <strong>scoring method</strong> mentioned to do daily reflection. They are self-evaluations regarding questions like “<strong>Did I do my best to …</strong>” (eg prioritize, meditate, sit in good posture and etc). Compared with other evaluations, this kind of question reminds me that <strong>I have control over my behavior and I shouldn’t blame anyone else if a certain desire is unmet</strong>. I will report the scores every day to my wife to make them accountable. (Thank you, my wife, you are a great listener!)</p>

<p>The score here is an average of several items during the day. Some days are good, and some are bad. Some habits are hard to get rid of or acquire while some don’t take that long. Doing daily reflection also helps me <strong>stay on track with my goal and progression</strong>. I normally will feel proud if I can score 90+ and feel a bit frustrated if it is lower than 80. This scoring method can also help me <strong>find the pattern and reflect upon when my willpower is the weakest</strong>. For example, I found myself easily getting hooked on excessive phone usage after dinner, so I learned to keep my phone away before dinner. If some items consistently score high after several weeks, then I have a strong belief that it becomes my habit and can be removed from my daily reflection score system.</p>

<h1 id="3-triggering-good-habits-and-avoiding-bad-ones">3 Triggering good habits and avoiding bad ones</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. — Aristotle</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used to be got distracted by social media and short videos a lot and they are habits I want to get rid of. I even tested myself that “I will only watch one clip of a short video” then I opened the app, and after 1 hour, I realized that I can’t stop. Our willpower is limited and we need some help to deal with various distractions in our modern world.</p>

<p>That’s why I decided to follow the methods mentioned in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a> and <strong>make the bad habits hard to do</strong>. I went crazy: I hid all my friends’ moments on WeChat so whenever I opened the friend circle, there is no new feeds. I put my phone somewhere hard to reach, so I don’t need to worry about myself using it when my willpower is low. By using this method, my screen time went down quite a lot and allowed me more time to do the things I love/need to do.</p>

<p>I also tried to <strong>make the good habits easy or fun to do</strong>. For example, for meditation, I bought a <a href="https://a.co/d/3M46Am1">Digital Finger Counter</a> so my daily meditation becomes easier to follow. Seeing the counter also makes the time more visible and helps me make progress over time.</p>

<h1 id="remarks">Remarks</h1>

  <p>Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years. — Bill Gates</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am lucky to have the chance to fully experience 2022 and find my happiness level higher than before.</p>

<p>The road to happiness is blocked by our ignorance and lack of knowledge. We are often told what to do, and what is expected, and born with the constraint of our culture. I used this post as a reflection and a wish to help you find something useful, to <strong>enable your possibility of less suffering and more happiness</strong>.</p>

<p>Coping from what Robert said: “Writing about personal productivity always feels somewhat self-indulgent; it inevitably comes down to ‘this is how I do things – you should do it too!’.” That’s not my intention and what I suggested here is only a reference or I should say something that works for me. I hope it can help you but it may not 😃</p>

<p>Time is limited. Attention is also limited. To do something great requires persistence and consistency. Luckily, we still have time and when we can focus our attention on those truly important things, they will come, eventually 😉</p>

My personal record for now is climbing V8 indoor, V7 outdoor, 5.12b indoor sport and 5.11b outdoor sport. I wouldn’t consider myself as a climber progressed very well considering how long I have climbed but I experienced a lot during the 4 years journey: training for a sport, making many friends with totally different background, injury management and self-motivation. I want to share them with you and hopefully motivate you a bit about rock climbing. :)</p>

<h3 id="april-2018-start-climbing-in-hongkong">April 2018: Start climbing in Hongkong.</h3>
<p>The reason why I started is because I watched a Youtube video Alex Honnold doing rock climbing. The first reaction I had was “Wow, that’s so cool. I wanna give it a try”. And that’s how I start it.</p>

<p>The first experience was quite fun: though I felt a bit nervous up there, I found myself quite enjoy solving the bouldering problems. Unfortunately, the gym is a bit far and I didn’t find a friend there who can take me to the gym to keep doing it. So I didn’t climb again until I got back to mainland China and in Chengdu, where I did my summer internship, I start climbing consistently.</p>

<h3 id="june---august-2018-climbing-in-chengdu">June - August 2018: Climbing in Chengdu.</h3>
<p>The gym in Chengdu is quite small, like most of the climbing gym in China, the whole climbing wall is filled with lots of climbing holds. They are like spray wall, which gives a lot of opportunity to create new routes by ourselves instead of following the existing routes given by the route setter. At that time, since I was pretty newbie, I just climb from the easiest and cheer all the improvements along the way: V0, V1, V2 …. . I went there twice or three times a week and I got hooked deeply by that sport: <strong>The climbing progression, friendly community, beauty of solving a bouldering problem and flow during climbing</strong>. I enjoy the time I am on the wall, focus on the problem and climb my way up. I also enjoy the time I sit on the pad, chatting with other climbers about the problem and learn from them about the beta (the way how the problem can be solved). I made a good friend there and I call him brother Zhang. The one thing I remember he told was that <strong>climbing is a lifetime sport and we can also treat it as a lifestyle</strong> — it can be with us for a long time, even when we get past 60s. This is true because climbing, compared with other high-intensity sport like basketball and football, is safer and its unique components inside can with us for a long time. I can go deeper here but the main point is that, <strong>when I am 70s, hopefully I will be still on the wall and enjoy the fun from climbing itself</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="september-2018---june-2019-climbing-in-beijing">September 2018 - June 2019: Climbing in Beijing.</h3>

<p>After internship, I went back to Beijing for my final year as an undergraduate student. At that period, climbing becomes my new routine. I climb at least 2 times per week if the gym is accessible. I found myself motivated to progress along the way and became more and more aware of my body and health status. Through consistently climbing, I:</p>
<ul>
  <li>lost 10 pounds of weight (~5kg)</li>
  <li>Climbed my first V4 in Beijing</li>
  <li>Met many open-minded and friendly climber</li>
  <li>Built strong connections with some climber friends</li>
  <li>Climbed my first outdoor top rope in Beijing (Baihe, JingLingGu).</li>
  <li>…</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="july---december-2019-climbing-in-new-york">July - December 2019: Climbing in New York.</h3>

<p>I come to New York for my graduate study and I was excited for both my study and climbing there. I heard the bouldering style in USA is quite different from those in China: more big volume and less small holds. I also heard the grade is softer and I probably can climb one grade higher than I did in China. I was very curious to see what the climbing looks like in the other side of the world. It doesn’t disappoint me. The climbing gym around New York is much bigger than the gym I went to in China and the routes are more sparse on the wall, which makes <strong>the route itself more like an art piece</strong>. I explored almost all the climbing gym around New York: the cliffs at LIC, Brooklyn bouldering gym, the Gravity Vault, Central Rock Gym and etc. I met many strong climbers and through regular seeing each other, the bond becomes stronger and stronger over time. It feels like <strong>a new home for me</strong>, where I can find comfort and peace during the stressful job haunting period.</p>

<p>About the bouldering problems, they are more creative and dynamic compared with those in Beijing. Like my friends said, the grade is indeed softer and I got my first V5 around August 2019 and first V6 around the end of the year. But focusing on grade is actually too subjective to become a good climber: Different gyms have different route setters and the grade is usually quite subjective and individual specific — If I always climb my favorite style, the V6 bouldering problem may feel like a V5 for me. But to be an versatile and good climber, I need to climb different styles and improve my weakness along the way. Also, some gyms are just generally softer than the other and some gyms just so hard-core, we learnt to be humble in those gyms. No matter what, the joy comes from climbing, for me is still tremendous and I was determined to climb harder and harder.</p>

<h3 id="january---july-2020-covid-time-climbing-at-home">January - July 2020: COVID time, climbing at home.</h3>
<p>At the beginning of 2020, COVID comes to USA. I have to stay at home most of the time after traveling back from Mexico. Also because of COVID, I am allowed to take classes remotely, so I moved to Chicago to stay with my girlfriend. At that time, I climb mostly at gym First Ascent and I can still do some light climbing in the beginning of February before the gym shuts down. On March 2020, almost all the gym shuts down and I have no where to climb. So during March to August 2020, I almost didn’t climb but rather doing some <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/how-to-use-a-hangboard-to-train-for-rock-climbing.html">hangboards</a> at home to train my finger strength and upper body strength. I remember the phase clearly because at that time I was quarantine with my girlfriend in a no more than 200 square feet room. I bought a portable pullup bar, short rope and portable hangboard to do the training. Surprisingly, through week by week training, I did my first one-arm pull up around May 2020 and I was quite happy at that time.</p>

<h3 id="august---december-2020-climbing-at-chicago">August - December 2020: climbing at Chicago.</h3>
<p>After the Independence Day in 2020, the rock climbing gym gradually opens up. I started going back to the gym and gradually increase the frequency. The go-to gym for me is “First Ascent” and like before, I made even more many friends there, some of them I still connect with regularly even though I moved to Seattle. It doesn’t take long before I get back to my previous climbing level since I was still doing some exercise at home. And at this time, my upper body strength is indeed much stronger than before, especially compared with my finger strength. It is actually a double edged sword: it helps overcome gravity but in the same time, since my finger strength is not in a comparable state with my upper body strength, those big muscles put much more stress on my finger, which gradually raises the chance of getting injured.</p>

<p>The lock-down period makes me even more realized <strong>how important climbing is to me</strong> since I never wanted to do a sport that much. So after I was able to climb in the gym again, I put even higher standard for myself to train and climb. I went to the gym at least 3 times per week, no matter how bad the weather is in Chicago. I even planed to be a professional climber: <strong>purely train, eat and rest</strong>. Those three components are all important for a climber. I started to record my training, calories and resting time. It felt uneasy because I realized my previous diet, those traditional Chinese food, doesn’t have much protein inside. I have to change the way I eat and going back to sleep in a good routine. Otherwise, it is easy to get hurt through heavy training.</p>

<p>Since I was a frequent visitor at some specific time slots, I consistently met some friends and one of them becomes my first sport climbing partner, Sean. Sean was a professional hockey player before doing rock climbing. And he started climbing around the same time as me so we are kind at the similar level at that time. Since he was a professional hockey player before, he is very fit and runs pretty fast, though not that relevant to climbing. He has the knowledge about how to train, eat and recover and it is super fun to meet a friend with a totally different background. He is humorous and considerate and taught me how to do sport climbing. I climbed regularly with him since September 2020 and we usually met around 8AM in front of his backyard and drove directly to the gym. It was an amazing period of time where we cheered each other up and trained together for higher grade and harder problems. I climbed my first V7 around October 2020 and got my lead climbing certificate around November.</p>

<h3 id="january-2021---march-2022-climbing-in-gravity-vault">January 2021 - March 2022: climbing in Gravity Vault.</h3>
<p>Since my girlfriend and I both finished graduate study, we both decided to move to New York and start our career there. We decided to live in Hoboken, NJ and the only gym accessible to someone without a car there is Gravity Vault (GV).</p>

<p>I know I will climb more than 3 times per week, so I persuade my girlfriend successfully to live around the climbing gym so that I can save a lot commuting time. In the end, we live 5 minutes walking distance from the gym and it felt amazing. Saving (45 - 5) * 2 * 3 = 240 minutes = 6 hours per week is absolutely a good deal for someone loves climbing and hate commuting :)</p>

<p>I ambitiously bought GV’s annual pass and since I made many friends there in the end, after the annual pass expires, I can still go to the gym relying on my friends’ guest passes without paying anything :D</p>

<p>Looking back, I would describe this period of time where I explored systematic training and push my limit further and further. I tried different kinds of training program online: <a href="https://www.macrofit.co/climberfit/">Alex Puccio training program</a>, <a href="https://www.trainingbeta.com/bouldering-strength-and-power-program/">TrainingBeta program</a> and some other online resources. I got hooked into <a href="https://www.moonboard.com/">moonboard</a> and training on it twice per week. I was proud that I reached my high level again and got my first V8 indoor and finished a all the V1 - V5 benchmark problems on Moonboard. But …  excessive training comes with a cost — <strong>injury</strong>. Due to high volume of climbing and not-enough resting, my right hand PIP joint feels quite stiff every morning I wake up. I ignored it in the beginning and then it exaggerated. It feels pain in some normal activities even.</p>

<p>So after February 2022, I was in a recovery mode and climb with injuries along the way. It was not that fun but I learnt a few lessons from it. I will discuss this in a different blog. Stay tuned :)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Life" /><category term="Climbing" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My journey about rock climbing]]></summary></entry></feed>
