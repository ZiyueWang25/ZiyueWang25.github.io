Learnt about induction circuits, transformerLens, induction heads, hooks, reverse-engineering induction circuits. These material opened a new view for me about how to understand LLM. I find some part hard to understand though and skipped some of the exercise as I don't want to spend too much time on this topic for now.
5. Around 3 hours to finish [Topic 8 Interpretability](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15CSZ09T0LQ4_BAM7_NcGDy5sTVneFJQw?usp=sharing) in [DLC](https://github.com/jacobhilton/deep_learning_curriculum/blob/master/8-Interpretability.md). It didn't take me too long because ARENA courses covered most of it. 
6. Around 2.5 hours to finish [week2_d1_intro_to_RL](https://arena-ch2-rl.streamlit.app/), it works like a memory refresher about some RL concepts. It is nice to check the detail of some RL environments.

1. Followed [Deep Learning Curriculum](https://github.com/jacobhilton/deep_learning_curriculum) and finished [Topic 1 Transformer](https://github.com/jacobhilton/deep_learning_curriculum/blob/master/1-Transformers.md), it takes me about 20 hours but I learnt a lot throughout the process. I wrote a post about it [here](https://ziyuewang25.github.io/blog/2023/DLC-T1-Transformer/)
2. Read Mechanistic Interpretability related materials: [Concrete Steps to Get Started in Transformer Mechanistic Interpretability](https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/getting-started) and Google Internal documents about Introduction to Alignment.

1. DDPM and DDIM diffusion Pytorch version replication: [DiffusionModel-DeepLearningAI-Pytorch.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LcxLcVfxeFQWlEEWVTBx_LfNMaY3CoNg?usp=sharing) . It takes me a while to collect the data to mimic the short [course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/how-diffusion-models-work/) on DeepLearning.AI and in the end I decide to use MNIST data with customized label to replicate the results.  The script works well and I am glad to see the model can generate digits according to the given conditions.
2. Kaggle LLM Nerd-Off. Checked out the existing model performance and competition data details. Since the model size constraint is 1B, it seems to me that specialized model to deal with different kind of input is the way to go. Also, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods are definitely important.
3. Some more readings about AI Safety in [week 1](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/ai-alignment-curriculum). It is fun to see the [Specification Gaming](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-ai-ingenuity) issue.

5. Consultation with 80k hours works well. I am glad I did it :)

# 2023-06-07
1. Reviewed previous experience about [DeepLOB](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03668) and [Kaggle Gravitation Wave Detection Competition](https://github.com/ZiyueWang25/Kaggle_G2Net). Feels like it has been quite a while. I miss the feeling of doing DL models.
2. Reviewed [How Diffusion Models Work](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/how-diffusion-models-work/) short course again on DeepLearning.AI. I will work on replicating it in Pytorch/JAX. It looks fun!
