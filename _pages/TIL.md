1. [Why did all of the public reproduction of GPT-3 fail? In which tasks should we use GPT-3.5/ChatGPT?](https://jingfengyang.github.io/gpt): A practical point of view to compare different LLM reproduction and application issue.
2. [ImageBind](https://imagebind.metademolab.com/): wow, the idea is pretty straightforward: learning the joint embedding from multiple modalities. Using image as the central embedding. Interesting!

1. [Harnessing the power of LLMs in Practice](https://github.com/Mooler0410/LLMsPracticalGuide): the chart inside is quite informative and the future trend is also thoughtful: evaluation on real-world datasets, alignment, safety.
2. To do great things, focus on small stuff. 
3. To make a fortune, help 1-billion people or make a grand breakthrough.

1. [Now Page](https://nownownow.com/): A simple but quite informative and fun page created by Derek Sivers. 
2. [DataComp](https://www.datacomp.ai/): A framework about improving dataset by fixing model.
   1. [Detoxify](https://github.com/unitaryai/detoxify): model to remove unsafe content.
   2. Deduplication using constrastive learning. [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.04323.pdf)
   3. Face detection and blurring for privacy. [detection model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04714). [blurring effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06191)
3. We definitely need to advocate for ourselves.
4. Cleaning up the system can be time-consuming and a headache.
