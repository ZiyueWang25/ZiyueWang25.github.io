1. [NeRF - Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf): First time tackling 3D image synthesis problem. Followed [tiny_nerf.ipynb](https://github.com/bmild/nerf/blob/master/tiny_nerf.ipynb) notebook and added hierarchical sampling on it. [tiny_nerf_with_hierarchical_sampling.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1U18TrmcnL1TpZj1R-qv43hsxfu_DizOc?usp=sharing)
2. [NeRF in the Wild](https://nerf-w.github.io/): add a series of extensions to NeRF to address dynamic subjects captured under uncontrolled setting.

# 2023-05-13
1. [Project Starline](https://blog.google/technology/research/project-starline/): 3D display to connect people. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDgToq5aXh0&ab_channel=GoogleAR%26VR)
2. [Novel View Synthesis with Diffusion Models](https://3d-diffusion.github.io/): 3D generation from a single image.
3. [NeRF in the Dark: High Dynamic Range View Synthesis from Noisy Raw Images](https://bmild.github.io/rawnerf/): 
4. [Time-Travel Rephotography](https://time-travel-rephotography.github.io/): use styleGAM2 framework to project old photo into modern high-resolution photos
5. [HyperNeRF: A Higher-Dimensional Representation for Topologically Varying Neural Radiance Fields](https://hypernerf.github.io/)

# 2023-05-12
1. [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper): English speech recognition
2. [Zero Redundancy Optimizer](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/zero/) :partitioning various model training states across the available devices
3. [BLOOM: A 176B-Parameter Open-Access Multilingual Language Model](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/bloom)
4. I got a personal poem written by Melanie Reed when we walk around Green Lake. It is beautiful and touching.

# 2023-05-11
1. [80,000 hours](https://80000hours.org/): 80,000 hours in yourÂ career. The [key ideas](https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/) page is amazing.
2. [PaLM2](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-palm-2-ai-large-language-model/)
3. [UL2](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/10/ul2-20b-open-source-unified-language.html): A way to include encoder like and decoder like training objective together.
4. Some exploration about green card application @ Australia, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden. Be mentally prepared for the Chinese discrimination in the USA.

# 2023-05-10 
1. [Why did all of the public reproduction of GPT-3 fail? In which tasks should we use GPT-3.5/ChatGPT?](https://jingfengyang.github.io/gpt): A practical point of view to compare different LLM reproduction and application issue.
2. [ImageBind](https://imagebind.metademolab.com/): wow, the idea is pretty straightforward: learning the joint embedding from multiple modalities. Using image as the central embedding. Interesting!

# 2023-05-09
1. [Harnessing the power of LLMs in Practice](https://github.com/Mooler0410/LLMsPracticalGuide): the chart inside is quite informative and the future trend is also thoughtful: evaluation on real-world datasets, alignment, safety.
2. To do great things, focus on small stuff. 
3. To make a fortune, help 1-billion people or make a grand breakthrough.


# 2023-05-08
1. [Now Page](https://nownownow.com/): A simple but quite informative and fun page created by Derek Sivers. 
2. [DataComp](https://www.datacomp.ai/): A framework about improving dataset by fixing model.
   1. [Detoxify](https://github.com/unitaryai/detoxify): model to remove unsafe content.
   2. Deduplication using constrastive learning. [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.04323.pdf)
   3. Face detection and blurring for privacy. [detection model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04714). [blurring effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06191)
3. We definitely need to advocate for ourselves.
4. Cleaning up the system can be time-consuming and a headache.
