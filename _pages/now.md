Updated August 12th, 2023, from Seattle, Washington, United States.

1. Project-wise: I am doing [Deep Learning Curriculum](https://github.com/jacobhilton/deep_learning_curriculum/tree/master) and [ARENA](https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_2.0). I have finished 5 out of 9 chapters of DLC and 3 out of 4 chapters of ARENA. I get motivated by the AI Safety issue and hope to work on it in the future.
2. Reading-wise: I mostly read papers and blog posts recently about AI research. I am recently reading [The most important century](https://www.cold-takes.com/most-important-century/) series. You can find my activities on my Goodreads [page](https://www.goodreads.com/vincentwang), though I don't have much update on it recently.
3. Career-wise: I just got back to work for a week after a long month vacation in China. I got up to speed and I am about to apply for AI Safety Research Engineer roles.
4. Climbing-wise: After steroid injection on April 26th on my TFCC and right middle finger PIP tenosynovitis, I observed a lot improvement over the past weeks, but I started feeling pain again on my PIP joint last week. It is really frustrating and I started thinking about other sports routine to follow. I became doubted about whether climbing is the sport for me. I'll definitely try to solve this. 
5. Life-wise: I am back from China and finally overcame the jet lag during the past week :) I spent most of my time doing AI Safety Research related projects and reading. Meanwhile, I am planning for a near trip to Mountain Rainier and Joshua Tree.
