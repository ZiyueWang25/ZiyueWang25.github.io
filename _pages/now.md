Updated June 24th, 2023, from Seattle, Washington, United States.

1. Project-wise: I am doing [Deep Learning Curriculum](https://github.com/jacobhilton/deep_learning_curriculum/tree/master) and [ARENA](https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_2.0). I get motivated by the AI Safety issue and hope to work on it in the future.
2. Reading-wise: I am reading [The Alignment Problem](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50489349)  & [The Are of Doing Science and Engineering](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/530415.The_Art_of_Doing_Science_and_Engineering). You can find my activities on my Goodreads [page](https://www.goodreads.com/vincentwang).
3. Career-wise: I am taking a one-month career break in the coming July since I will be in China. I am seriously considering working on AI Safety related issues. This post [Preventing an AI-related catastrophe](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/) inspired me a lot.
4. Climbing-wise: After steroid injection on April 26th on my TFCC and right middle finger PIP tenosynovitis, I observed a lot improvement over the past weeks. I don't have any pain related with the PIP joint anymore and my finger strength has improved a lot, almost back to my previous level. Currently, TFCC still bothers me a bit. I am actively working on it, hopefully I can get fully back to normal in July. I am still following [No Hang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_-YapmymjA) Training plan, it works well! 
5. Life-wise: I will be back to China this Friday, excited!
