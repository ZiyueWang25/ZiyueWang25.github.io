I am a Software Engineer at [Google](www.google.com). Before this, I was a Quant Researcher at [BNP Paribas](https://group.bnpparibas/en/) and [Aigen Investment](http://www.aigen-im.com/).

My biggest focus right now is about [AI Safety](https://ziyuewang25.github.io/blog/2023/AI-Safety/). I believe the idea of [Effective Altruism](https://80000hours.org/2020/08/misconceptions-effective-altruism/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=80KMAR-EA/LTism&utm_content=145184936813&utm_term=effective%20altruism&gclid=CjwKCAjw5_GmBhBIEiwA5QSMxBaVik5xPNtCy6BxyqMy4EVvjN63iBJwNsi11v8uCi8sMDp82joXEhoCTsEQAvD_BwE) and I donate 10% of my income.

Hobby-wise, I [enjoy rock climbing](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVG0jDqJMqJ/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet) and hiking. I like [build models and find rules](https://www.kaggle.com/vincentwang25/Home) inside huge amounts of data.

Education-wise, I got my master degree in Financial Engineering from the "[Best](https://quantnet.com/mfe-programs-rankings/)" program in the US.

Hope you can find something fun / helpful here!
