I am a Research Engineer at Google DeepMind Frontier Safety team in San Francisco. I work on dangerous capability evaluation, elicitation and mitigation. Previously, I worked on improving Gemini Coding capability through pretraining and RL, and spent some time doing algorithmic trading in Wall Street.

I believe the idea of [Effective Altruism](https://80000hours.org/2020/08/misconceptions-effective-altruism/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=80KMAR-EA/LTism&utm_content=145184936813&utm_term=effective%20altruism&gclid=CjwKCAjw5_GmBhBIEiwA5QSMxBaVik5xPNtCy6BxyqMy4EVvjN63iBJwNsi11v8uCi8sMDp82joXEhoCTsEQAvD_BwE) and I donate 10% of my income.

Hobby-wise, I [enjoy rock climbing](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVG0jDqJMqJ/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet), writing blogs, hanging out with friends and hiking. I like [build models and find rules](https://www.kaggle.com/vincentwang25/Home) inside huge amounts of data.

Education-wise, I got my master degree in Financial Engineering from the "[Best](https://quantnet.com/mfe-programs-rankings/)" program in the US.
