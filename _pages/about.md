I am currently a Software Engineer at [Google](www.google.com). I was a Quant Researcher at [BNP Paribas](https://group.bnpparibas/en/) and interned at [Aigen Investment](http://www.aigen-im.com/) before but switch to tech industry on May 2022 for the passion of AI.

I studied Mathematics and Financial Engineering (FE) during undergraduate study from [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en) and got Master degree in FE from [Baruch College, City University of New York](http://mfe.baruch.cuny.edu/) (2023 [Best](https://quantnet.com/mfe-programs-rankings/) FE programs in the US).

In my spare time, I enjoy rock climbing ([video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVG0jDqJMqJ/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet)) and explore AI/ML related stuff. I used to playing [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vincentwang25/Home) competition day and night and reached 3rd place of a competition called G2Net Gravitational Wave Detection ([Winning Solution](https://github.com/ZiyueWang25/Kaggle_G2Net)).

I want to contribute to the fascinating AI community. So I think hard, do fun experimentation, create valuable content and serve others. Hope you enjoy it!
