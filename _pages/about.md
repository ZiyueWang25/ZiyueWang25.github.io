I am a Software Engineer at [Google](www.google.com). I was a Quant Researcher at [BNP Paribas](https://group.bnpparibas/en/) and interned at [Aigen Investment](http://www.aigen-im.com/) before but switch to tech industry on May 2022 for the passion of AI.

I studied Mathematics and Financial Engineering (FE) during undergraduate study from [RUC](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en) and got Master degree in FE from [Baruch College, CUNY](http://mfe.baruch.cuny.edu/) (2023 [Best](https://quantnet.com/mfe-programs-rankings/) FE programs in the US).

In my spare time, I enjoy rock climbing ([video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVG0jDqJMqJ/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet)), hiking and explore AI safety related topics. I used to playing [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vincentwang25/Home) and got a Competition Master title on March, 2022. 

I believe the idea of [Effective Altruism](https://80000hours.org/2020/08/misconceptions-effective-altruism/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=80KMAR-EA/LTism&utm_content=145184936813&utm_term=effective%20altruism&gclid=CjwKCAjw5_GmBhBIEiwA5QSMxBaVik5xPNtCy6BxyqMy4EVvjN63iBJwNsi11v8uCi8sMDp82joXEhoCTsEQAvD_BwE) and I donate 10% of my income to [the most effective charities](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/best-charities-to-donate-to-2023) in the world. My biggest concern and focus right now is about **AI Safety**. It can cause [catastrophic risk](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/) if we continue to chase higher AI performance without enough attention to the safety issue. I am doing AI safety related self-study and projects to upskill and try to get more involved. If you find the content here relate with you and want to get in touch, feel free to reach out!
