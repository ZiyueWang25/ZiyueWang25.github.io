From my own injury recovery experience, I gradually realize how important it is to warm up. There are many great resources online, so I decide to gather them down here for reference.

# PIP Joint
- https://www.camp4humanperformance.com/blog-2/pip-jugs
	- **high-rate rotational loading is more stressful on the fingers than static loading**
	- when you can get your middle and distal bones around the edge of the jug, in that context, **most of the stress in the fingers goes into the PIP joint.**
	- The PIP Joint can suffer from overdoing easy climbing.
	- A high volume of easy training can be **counterproductive**.
	- PIP swelling are due to
		- **Collateral ligaments** (sides of the joint)
		- **A3 pulleys** (hold the tendon close to the joint)
		- **Volar plate** (ligament across the joint where A3 attaches)
	- **dosage** of stress stype is more important than intensity of the load.
	- Treatment:
		- **Avoid the high-rate rotational loading** for a few weeks to months.
		- Don't spend weeks to months climbing easy terrain. **Especially in a gym.**
		- Keep loading your fingers in an **easily trackable way** (ladder style). Fingerboard, campus board (feet on), spray wall etc.
		- Be **patient as hell** in rehab! That's the not easy part.

	- PIP joint accounts for 85% of the motion for grip strength
	- a hinge type joint which is stable only in the sagittal plane (flexing and extending)

	- **Three grades of collateral ligament injuries**
	- General recommendations:
		- **Stiffness and joint contraction** are common with injury.
		- There is **no consensus** on best treatment strategies!
		- Most injuries **rarely return to full active range of motion.**
		- **Treatment within 4 weeks** is key.
		- Immobilization beyond 3 weeks causes **irreversible loss of motion!**
		- **Early diagnosis** and motion are suggested (specifically extensor power).

	- **Doing something like finger-glides on a regular basis is not necessarily “healthy” for the joints of your fingers.**
	- It really comes down to understanding the why behind any intervention. Everything comes with a cost.

# TFCC injury

	- Components:
		- A triangular shaped **fibro-cartilaginous disc** (shock absorbing, guiding motion)    
		-   Ligaments between the **ulna and radius** on both sides (palmar & dorsal)
		-   Ligaments between the **ulna and the carpal bones**
		-   A **meniscal type homologoue** (shock absorbing)
		-   Sub-sheath of the **ECU tendon**
	- Cause: repetitive axial loads to the wrist when the hand is in ulnar deviation and pronation.
	- the **dosage** of the stress is the culprit
	- Even though it is still recommended to do **conservative management first**, the statistics show that only 1/3 of patients get symptomatic relief. That number is highly dependent on the compliance but does show how tricky these injuries can be.

	1. 5:3 x 3 repeater
	2. 30s yielding isotonic
	3. 5s overcoming isotonic
	4. 5 rep isotonic
	5. velocity isotonic
	6. 1-arm 90-degree PIMA with ulnar deviation
	7. 1-arm 120-degree PIMA with ulnar deviation
	8. 1-arm weighted hammer / band PIMA
	9. concentric focused ulnar deviation with hammer/band
	10. rapid concentric ulnar deviation with hammer/band
	- Building capacity in this part of the wrist is **essential for staying injury free.**

	- ![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59d03d018a02c7512bf8b05f/a32e5e47-c99c-4c35-b676-8ea0133e3e68/%238+eccentric+loads.png?format=750w)
	- Alternative
		- **Keeping the wrist neutral** will do the same thing (mechanically), and it feels way less risky (good for pain reduction), especially if you're an athlete with clicking in the wrist.
		-   **Wrist flexion isometric** (shown on the left). Go heavy and hold for a longer time under tension.
		-   **Wrist extension isometric** (opposite side of the forearm). Same idea.
		-   **Hammer curl isometric.** Curl a heavy dumbbell to 90-degrees at the elbow (thumb up) and hold for time.
		-   **Tricep extension isometric.** Opposite direction. Lower a heavy band or cable machine to 90-degrees (thumb up) and hold for time.
	- Eccentric flexion over a bench is not a very practical exercise.
	- With pain at the wrist, **keeping it neutral is a safe and reliable method.**
	- This controlled load needs to **change as your rehab progresses.**


# A2 Pulley Injury

# Taping
- https://www.camp4humanperformance.com/blog-2/finger-taping
	- reducing stress to prevent an injury doesn’t make sense
	- **taping should be part of progressive rehab plan,** not a method to _prevent_ one.
	- ![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59d03d018a02c7512bf8b05f/a051125d-57f1-4061-a6fa-702a217606a2/%2329+finger+tape.jpg?format=1500w)
	- Pros
		- provide structural support and reduce pulley stress
			- H-tape is good for A2, A3 and A4. but **not collateral ligament and volar plate injuries**
		- provide proprioception (awareness) in the joint
		- Modify PIP joint range of motion: make it harder to do full-crimp
		- Reduce pain: feels safe and reduces stress and anxiety.
	- Cons
		- not preventative. Listen to the body and back off the volume if it sore
		- leads to further overuse.
		- modifying ROM for too long can reduce it long-term

# General Rehab

	- consistency for rehab
	- Standardizing warm up - Injury prevention program (IPP): [C1](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59d03d018a02c7512bf8b05f/t/61f00ab0203e272d1b5f7aa0/1643121335193/Circuit+1.pdf), [C2](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59d03d018a02c7512bf8b05f/t/61f00ef14ef0dd0b26f75909/1643122431683/Circuit+2.pdf), [C3](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59d03d018a02c7512bf8b05f/t/61f00f6e8c861241421a2f87/1643122554700/Circuit+3.pdf), [C4](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59d03d018a02c7512bf8b05f/t/61f00fada2b6c118a65a7ddc/1643122615792/Circuit+4.pdf), [C5](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59d03d018a02c7512bf8b05f/t/61f0103f1e605f34fe47ea7e/1643122761385/Circuit+5.pdf), [C6](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59d03d018a02c7512bf8b05f/t/61f0107a2ee7797ce0fd07b2/1643122816517/Circuit+6.pdf)

		- then: 30mm for A2, A3 pulleys.

	-   **Absence of pain** does not equal health.
	-   **Persistence of pain** does not mean it’s not healing.
	-   Connective responds slowly, so **you have to be patient.** ASIDE FROM LOADING AND RECOVERING THERE IS NO METHOD TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN FASTER!
	-   Not loading at all (under loading) often times is more stressful for athletes. **There are always things you can do!**
	-   Get help from a **professional**.

	- There are **fewer rules with finger training** than you likely think. Using a bigger edge to make your fingers stronger is totally acceptable.
